# Port Scanner (skanneri.py)

This is a simple Python script that scans ports from 80 to 443 on a target host.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the script up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `skanneri.py` file.
2. Open the `skanneri.py` file in a text editor.
3. Replace the `"127.0.0.1"` in the `target` variable with your target IP address.
4. Save the changes and close the text editor.
5. Open a terminal/command prompt.
6. Navigate to the directory containing the `skanneri.py` file.
7. Run the script with the command `python skanneri.py`.

The script will then scan ports 80 through 443 on the target host and print whether each port is open or closed.
